## Overview

**Duki’s WL GUI** is a consolidated enhancement framework developed exclusively for **Wizard Life**.  
It provides a unified, reliable, and performance-optimized control layer that improves quality of life,  
combat responsiveness, interface clarity, and automation capabilities while maintaining stability  
within a legacy, unmaintained game environment.

The GUI is built with a focus on:
- Predictable behavior  
- Minimal interference with normal gameplay  
- Fast response times  
- Clean internal architecture  
- Seamless integration between GUI, chat commands, and remote operation

This project is actively maintained and refined for long-term stability.

## Installation

To initialize the GUI, define a theme and load the main script:

```
theme = "Default"
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duki-dotcom/WL-GUI-PBETA/refs/heads/main/dist/main.lua"))()
```

Themes can be changed by modifying the `theme` value before execution.
